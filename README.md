# EmptyTauri + Backend C#

Tauri + React + Typescript + C# via [TauriDotNetBridge](https://github.com/plainionist/TauriDotNetBridge)

That's just template for my own purpose, ready to use, with example of communication between frontend and backend.

In the project, the title bar from windows is already turned off by default.

## Getting Started
The initial setup is actually simple.

After downloading the project, install all dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation/)
```
pnpm i
```

and that's all, now you're able to run app by command
``` 
pnpm run tauri dev
```

or just build it yourself
```
pnpm run tauri build
```
